This is a currently developing project in preperation for my Computer Science A-Level course work.
I was tasked to make a user friendly GUI system using Python, SqlLite3, and Tkinter for TheGuildOfCeramicArts 
The system must be able to:
  Enter and store the details of Guild members
  Enter and store the products for sale
  Enter and store Guild member’s orders
  Create and store an invoice for each order
  Produce replacement invoices for cancelled orders
  Check for unpaid invoices that are over 28 days old
  Standard delivery charge of £5.99
  All orders over £50.00 not including delivery fee will receive a 5% discount
  If order in cancelled then they will be charged 20% cost of the goods
